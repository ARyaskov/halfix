TODO list:
 [x] boot Windows 7
 [ ] boot Windows 8
     ~ BSOD: KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR. most likely a hardware issue (hard drive?)
 [ ] boot Windows 10
 [ ] boot Ubuntu
     ~ kernel panic on 16.04, something to do with decompression, happens on bochs too
 [ ] gui (perhaps Imgui?)
 [ ] swap floppy drives (NT 3.51 install)
 [ ] dynamic recompiler
 [ ] network support
 [ ] more robust savestate support
     ~ savestates work well, but they're only for debugging purposes. 
 [ ] vesa 4bpp
 [ ] svga, cirrus or s3 trio
 [ ] refactor VGA rendering code
 [ ] sound
 [ ] hardware virtualization
     ~ tried this before, kvm did not work well with SDL
 [ ] usb
 [ ] debugger interface

Things to fix:
 [ ] make cpu_get_trace a lot faster (10% execution time is spent there)
 [ ] byte align fields in struct decoded_instruction? (tests indicate byte alignment is 10-15% faster)
 [ ] remove state_hash from trace cache
