# Compatibility

Most operating systems work fine with the default configuration (32 MB RAM, no floppy drive, APIC/PCI/ACPI enabled). However, you might need to increase the RAM size or enable floppy drives. 

## DOS
All versions should work, although they might not boot from floppy disks due to unimplemented commands. Installing must be done on DOSBox or Bochs because swapping floppy disks is not supported. 

## Windows

### Windows 1.01
Boots from floppy disk image.

### Windows 2.02
Boots from floppy disk image.

### Windows 3.1
Boots from a 10 MB hard disk image. Mouse is laggy because it doesn't use `HLT`. 

### Windows 95
Boots from a 250 MB hard disk image. Works very well

### Windows 98 SE
Boots from a 300 MB hard disk image.

### Windows ME
Boots and runs. 

### Windows NT 4.0
Installs, boots, and runs. Very stable. Can self-virtualize if SP6 is installed. 

### Windows 2000
Boots and runs. 

### Windows XP
Installs, boots, and runs. Very stable. I recommend running with 128 MB RAM. 

### Windows Vista
Takes forever to boot with the Pentium 4 CPU configuration. Set IPS to around 50,000,000 to get the nice Aero theme. Run with 512 MB of RAM. 

### Windows 7
The disk image I created requires a Pentium 4 or better to boot (it hangs on a `#UD` exception on FXSAVE). Unstable, it crashed with a BSOD. Can't use CDs because not all commands are implemented. Run with 512 MB of RAM. 

### Windows 8
BSODs with a `KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR`. Probably a device problem. 

### Windows 10
Haven't tried.

## OS/2 

### 1, 2
Haven't tested. May not boot since floppy drive controller is completely inaccurate. 

### Warp 3
During boot, OS/2 will complain about how it can't load `VCOM.SYS` (but it will still boot). This is because we don't emulate serial ports. Edit the lines out of `CONFIG.SYS`.

### Warp 4.5
Don't jiggle the mouse during boot. It confuses the keyboard controller, which then confuses OS/2. Otherwise, it boots fine and is very stable. 

## Linux

### ISO Linux
Boots from CD and runs. 

### Damn Small Linux
Boots from CD and runs. Slightly longer boot time than Windows XP. 

### Debian
No PAE. Kernel doesn't like that. 

### Red Star OS 2
Boots fine, but mouse doesn't work. I suspect it has something to do with the keyboard controller outport. 

## ReactOS
Works fine, from the LiveCD. VGA emulation is funky, though. Icons don't render. Hopefully enabling VESA will fix that.
